<p align="center">
  English | <a href="./README_zh-CN.md">简体中文</a>
</p>

This framework provides a complete data quality evaluation system that performs multi-dimensional assessment of datasets using deep learning models.

## ✨ Core Features

- **🚀 Automatic Data Parallelism**: Automatically calculates data parallelism based on global GPU count and per-scorer GPU requirements
- **🎯 Intelligent GPU Allocation**: Supports multi-GPU tasks with automatic dedicated GPU resource allocation for each parallel task
- **📊 Dual Scoring Modes**: Distinguishes between **Pointwise** (per-sample scoring) and **Setwise** (whole-dataset scoring) modes
- **🔧 Configuration-Driven**: Easily manage models, evaluation metrics, and runtime parameters through YAML configuration files
- **💾 Structured Output**: Automatically merges and categorizes scoring results with support for viewing intermediate results
- **🔄 Parallel Execution**: Multiple scorers execute sequentially, with each scorer using data parallelism for acceleration
- **⏸️ Resume from Checkpoint**: Supports resuming interrupted evaluation tasks from where they left off, avoiding redundant computation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Configure YAML File

Create or modify a configuration file in the `configs/` directory, e.g., `configs/my_scorer.yaml`:

```yaml
# Data path configuration
input_path: /path/to/your/data.jsonl
output_path: results/my_experiment

# Global GPU configuration
num_gpu: 8                    # Total number of available GPUs
num_gpu_per_job: 1            # Default number of GPUs per task (can be overridden by scorers)

# Scorer configuration
scorers:
  # Example 1: Quality scorer (using 1 GPU)
  - name: DeitaQScorer
    model: /path/to/deita-quality-scorer
    max_length: 2048
    batch_size: 8
    num_gpu_per_job: 1
  
  # Example 2: Multi-GPU task (using 4 GPUs)
  - name: InfOrmScorer
    model: /path/to/INF-ORM-Llama3.1-70B
    batch_size: 8
    max_length: 2048
    num_gpu_per_job: 4
  
  # Example 3: Multiple scorers
  - name: PPLScorer
    model: /path/to/language-model
    batch_size: 16
    max_length: 2048
    num_gpu_per_job: 1
```

**Configuration Details**:
- **`input_path`**: Input data file path (JSONL format)
- **`output_path`**: Output results directory
- **`num_gpu`**: Total number of globally available GPUs (required)
- **`num_gpu_per_job`**: Global default GPUs per task (optional, default 1)
- **`resume`**: Whether to enable resume from checkpoint (optional, default false); see "Resume from Checkpoint" below
- **`scorers`**: List of scorers, each can specify its own `num_gpu_per_job` to override the global setting

### 2. Prepare Data

Ensure input data is in JSONL format, with one JSON object per line:

```json
{"instruction": "What is machine learning?", "output": "Machine learning is...",...}
{"instruction": "Explain neural networks", "output": "Neural networks are...",...}
```

**Field Requirements**:
- `instruction`: Question or instruction (required)
- `output`: Answer or output (required for QA-type scorers)
- `input`: Additional input field (optional)
- `id`: Unique identifier for each data item (**required when using resume from checkpoint**, for distinguishing and recovering each record)
- Other fields: Some scorers may require additional specific fields; please refer to the corresponding scorer documentation

### 3. Run Evaluation

```bash
python main.py --config configs/my_scorer.yaml
```

**Parameter Description**:
- `--config`: Path to YAML configuration file

### 4. Resume from Checkpoint

When an evaluation task is interrupted (e.g., OOM, machine failure) before completion, you can use the resume feature to continue from where it left off, avoiding redundant computation of already completed work.

**How to use**: Add `resume: true` to your configuration YAML:

```yaml
input_path: /path/to/your/data.jsonl
output_path: results/my_experiment
num_gpu: 8
resume: true                    # Enable resume from checkpoint

scorers:
  - name: DeitaQScorer
    model: /path/to/deita-quality-scorer
    batch_size: 8
```

**Important notes**:
- When using resume, **each record in the input data must contain an `id` field** to uniquely identify data and correctly restore progress
- The framework checks existing intermediate results under `output_path`, skips completed scorers or data shards, and only continues processing the unfinished parts

## 🔧 Data Parallelism Mechanism

### Automatic Parallelism Calculation

The framework automatically calculates data parallelism for each scorer:

```
data_parallel = num_gpu ÷ num_gpu_per_job
```

**Example**:
- 8 GPUs available globally
- Scorer A needs 1 GPU → data_parallel = 8 (data split into 8 parts for parallel processing)
- Scorer B needs 4 GPUs → data_parallel = 2 (data split into 2 parts for parallel processing)
- Scorer C needs 2 GPUs → data_parallel = 4 (data split into 4 parts for parallel processing)

### GPU Allocation Strategy

1. **Data Splitting**: Dataset is split into `data_parallel` parts
2. **Process Launch**: An independent process is launched for each data part
3. **GPU Assignment**: Each process sees its assigned GPUs through `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`
4. **Parallel Execution**: All processes run simultaneously without interference
5. **Result Merging**: Results are automatically merged after all processes complete

**Example: 8 GPUs, scorer requires 2 GPUs per job**
```
Job 0: GPU [0, 1] → Processes data shard 0
Job 1: GPU [2, 3] → Processes data shard 1
Job 2: GPU [4, 5] → Processes data shard 2
Job 3: GPU [6, 7] → Processes data shard 3
```

## 📤 Output Results

After completion, the following files will be generated in the `output_path` directory:

### Pointwise Scoring Results (`pointwise_scores.jsonl`)

Per-sample scoring results, each line corresponds to one record in the input data:

```json
{
  "id": 0,
  "scores": {
    "DeitaQScorer": {
      "score": 4.5
    },
    "PPLScorer": {
      "score": 12.34
    },
    "UPDScorer": {
      "score": 0.79
    }
  }
}
```

### Setwise Scoring Results (`setwise_scores.jsonl`)

Scoring results for the entire dataset (if any scorer returns overall scores):

```json
{
  "Task2VecScorer": {
    "score": 0.024327838269528,
    "num_samples": 32,
    "num_anomalous": 0,
    "num_truncated": 31,
    "truncation_rate": 0.96875,
    "last_layer_only": true,
    "embedding_dim": 768
  }
}
```

### Intermediate Results (`master_temp/`)

```
master_temp/
├── processed_data.jsonl              # Preprocessed data (with id added)
├── scorer_DeitaQScorer/              # Temporary directory for each scorer
│   ├── job_0/                        # Results from each parallel task

## ⚙️ Advanced Features

### Custom Scorers

1. Inherit from the `BaseScorer` class:

```python
from scorers.base_scorer import BaseScorer
from typing import Dict, List, Any

class MyCustomScorer(BaseScorer):
    def _validate_config(self):
        """Validate configuration parameters"""
        required = ["model", "batch_size"]
        for key in required:
            if key not in self.config:
                raise ValueError(f"Missing required config: {key}")
    
    def _setup(self):
        """Initialize model and resources"""
        self.model = load_model(self.config["model"])
    
    def score_item(self, data_item: Dict) -> Dict:
        """Score a single sample"""
        score = self.model.score(data_item["instruction"])
        return {"custom_score": score}
    
    def evaluate(self, dataset_path: str) -> List[Dict]:
        """Evaluate the entire dataset"""
        results = []
        with open(dataset_path, "r") as f:
            for line in f:
                item = json.loads(line)
                score = self.score_item(item)
                score["id"] = item["id"]
                results.append(score)
        return results
```

2. Register in `scorers/scores_info.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "MyCustomScorer",
  "module": "scorers.MyCustomScorer"
}
```

3. Use in configuration file:

```yaml
scorers:
  - name: MyCustomScorer
    model: /path/to/model
    batch_size: 8
```
